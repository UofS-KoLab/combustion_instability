# Model for Detection of Instability

## Objective:
The objective of this repository is to create a model capable of detecting combustion instability in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). Combustion instability can pose significant risks in aviation, and detecting it accurately is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient operations.

## Dataset:
The main dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in a Google Drive folder accessible via the following link: [Dataset Link]((https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16OKgQmwzbEZ5R8KgyiA1tDWLs9HAqIzY?usp=drive_link))

### Description of the Dataset:
- The dataset is located in the folder named "Data_09-23".
- It comprises 96 Excel files, each corresponding to a specific set of parameters used during data collection.
- The file named "stability_labeling.xlsx" contains labels for each file, indicating whether the combustion state represented by the data is stable or unstable.
- Each of the 96 files contains data with no headers, structured into three columns:
  1. Time (in seconds)
  2. Pressure
  3. Heat release (PMT)
- The data consists of 120,000 rows, with data sampling taken every 9.77x10^-5 seconds, resulting in a total duration of 12 seconds for each state.

## Test Dataset:
Additionally, there is a test dataset available in the "test_dataset" folder, which contains two Excel files representing collected test data. This dataset can be utilized to evaluate the performance of any model developed using the main dataset.


## Additional Information:
- In the folder named "plots", there are three subfolders with the names of the participants of the project. Each participant can save any plot generated by their code in their respective folder.
- Similarly, the "logs" folder follows the same structure as the "plots" folder, where participants can save any log files generated by their code.
- The "model" folder contains three subfolders with the names of each participant. Participants should upload their code (any Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts) in their respective folders. No additional data should be uploaded to this repository; it's only for code.
- For any new dataset, please DO NOT upload it directly to this repository. Instead, upload it to Google Drive and update this README file with the link to the new dataset. Create a folder (ONLY FOLDER) for the new dataset within the "Dataset" folder, following the same structure as the existing folders.


## Branch Naming Convention:
- Please use the following naming convention when creating branches:
  - Feature branches: `feature/<feature-name>`
  - Bug fix branches: `bugfix/<issue-number>`
  - Hotfix branches: `hotfix/<issue-number>`
  - Release branches: `release/<version-number>`
  - Experiment branches: `experiment/<experiment-name>`
  - Avoid using special characters or spaces in branch names, and use lowercase letters.
